        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
         <p>
         I'm just about a month and a half into designing my smart home during my spare time. In my view, some of the most meaningful interactions happen at the home, whether it's our morning rituals to kick off a productive day or the memorable dinner parties we put on for guests. At times we will have plenty of multi-tasking cases where we can't focus on the crux of what we find meaningful, hence why I think digital assistance is such a rich problem to explore. Currently, I'm investigating the idea of augmenting my home life style through Alexa and key Internet of Things items so that I can live out and better empathize with a problem space I think is crucial for the future of tech.

            <h4 class="featurette-heading">Apartment Layout and IOT</h4>
            <p>I've started permeating my apartment with key devices that usually govern a responsibility associated with a room. My Echo Dot is comfortably located near the rooms where I use it most, however its range is surprisingly powerful throughout my home.  Though in the early days of my design, I'm starting to gain a grasp as to which devices are actually most useful as voice-controlled entities (I still think text-based and GUI have a place given the current nascent state of assistance).  While I am currently going through the exercise of using devices in isolation and saying utterances pre-baked into these skills, I'm learning what feels truly natural to my everyday behavior.</p>

            <h4 class="featurette-heading">Room Ambience</h4>
            <p>I've connected some lamps to the Philips Hue hub which is connected to Alexa.  I'm able to set scenes and say phrases like "Alexa, turn on the lights" which is useful when I'm coming home from work and it's pitch dark. However, this still feels primitive to me: one can easily walk over to the light switch and no need for utterances.  Thus far, I've concluded that I'd like to figure out actions that trigger certain lamps for specific scenarios, as low-level actions such as turning on the light still feel odd using Alexa as a liaison.  Meanwhile, the way I'm conceptualizing scenes/moods around Alexa use cases has been largely inspired by Hue.</p>

            <p>I love experimenting with sous vide cooking and was excited to find out there is an immersion circulator hooked into Alexa. Having recently purchased <a href="https://www.chefsteps.com" target="_blank">Chefsteps' Joule</a>, I'm learning more about their philosophy in the kitchen and argument for voice assistance as an advantage to any cook's workflow.</p><br>
            <p>While functionality is limited right now, I imagine a scenario where my mis en place can be greatly streamlined or a time where I come from work and I can kick off a home cooked meal in a pinch.

            <h4>There's a time and place for voice control as an interaction paradigm.</h4>
	        <p>
	         As compared to text-based assistants, voice-controlled systems like Alexa enable me to far more loose with utterances.  That works fine for some of my use cases when I don't need to type on a keyboard and precisely engage in a complex flow via a screen.  However, I think the key to making voice control more practical is to enable the environment to respond to a user's emotional and physical context in a non-literal fashion.  That being said, I'm still wondering how soon we can deprecate GUI, given the current state of where we are with Natural Language.

            <h4>We need more IOT and standards in general.</h4>
	        <p>
	         I know that this is such a nascent space and it's obvious.  When I'm purchasing new IOT, I have to be very informed about which specific devices and their versions are compatible with Alexa.  In addition, the way I expect to behave with an IOT via Alexa requires very different learning curves and onboarding.  I can't wait for more devices to talk to each other and for this space to be more seamless for the user inside and outside the home.
