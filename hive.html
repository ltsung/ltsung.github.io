        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
         <p>
         The Search organization invested in incubating several product hypotheses through small team execution (1 product manager to ~1 designer to ~8 engineers).  My team was responsible for understanding ephemeral, geo-fenced searching needs on mobile.  Throughout the weeks we had radically pivoted, ultimately releasing as “Hive” to college graduates and young professionals in Canada and the United States.  We had believed that creating an answers and questions community could organically surface interesting problems that aren't easily solvable through traditional search. Much of the learnings around forming communities and curating questions form the framework for the widely released Yahoo Answers Now.
         </p>

         <p>
         I've been inspired by the lean design philosophy as detailed in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Designing-Great-Products/dp/1491953608" target="_blank">Lean UX: Designing Great Products with Agile Teams</a>.  Specifically, the hypothesis format has been useful in helping me drive a learning mindset, which is critical when navigating pivots.

            <h4 class="featurette-heading">Lab Studies</h4>
            <p>In my efforts to thoroughly investigate key value propositions for our young product, I partnered closely with the User Research team to set up a bi-weekly cadence of lab observations.  I also participated in interviewing the user and made it a point to capture their natural user language to better empathize with their mental models.  After each session, I would co-facilitate debriefs and early analysis prior to formalizing the report for the larger teams and stakeholders.</p>

            <h4 class="featurette-heading">Rapid Feature Testing</h4>
            <p>In the spirit of "working scrappy", at times I would code up wireframe-like prototypes to quickly experiment with possible features we thought about bringing into production.  For example, we wanted to explore the notion of enabling users to express moods and feelings through emoji to help add dimension to question ranking and community formation.  Therefore, I implemented a filtered stream where a user could sort on emotion types and a fun means of contributing to shared emotions on a Questions page.<br><br>

            <h4 class="featurette-heading">Initial Release and Campaigning</h4>
            <p>After landing on the hypothesis of forming communities around topics, we released an invite-gated experience for select regions in Canada and primarily friends and family in the United States. Because our hypothesis wasn't fully under the Yahoo brand umbrella, our small team campaigned grass-roots style and via Facebook ads where we saw first-hand how our key value propositions performed outside of initial lab testing.</p>

            <h4 class="featurette-heading">Refining the System</h4>
            <p>As we developed more confidence in our product, we wanted to take a step back and resolve unfinished design thinking.  In this case, I explored the app notification system.  In one of these diagrams, I show a traversal through the key use cases in the product and the types of alerts a user can expect for items implicitly and explicitly engaged with.  I noted patterns across notification types and tiered them in order to shed light on how to organize across in-app vs push notifications. Additionally, I considered how notifications could guide a user into buying into the product's value over time (e.g. a user feeling rewarded for answering n number of questions and reaching a top rank in the Hive community).<br><br>

            <h4>Set the team up to learn constantly.</h4>
	        <p>
	         It was crucial that each member of the team felt accountable to the product definition, design, development, and testing of the product.  One of my best accomplishments in facilitating learning was when I held a design workshop with the engineers where we riffed personas, scenarios, and wireframes in a “studio” fashion. It created shared understanding and built team rapport early on.

            <h4>Nail the crux of the user need.</h4>
	        <p>
	         The lean UX philosophy is all about enumerating assumptions regularly and quickly validating them.  This mindset was helpful when it came to learning about our assumptions of what users would find interesting.  We were humbled when we learned that our obsessions with features prevented us from ironing out a compelling product core.

            <h4>Shipping Weekly > Perfection.</h4>
	        <p>
	         It is too tempting as a designer to be fixated on the pixels and miss the big mark: our obligation is to get something real for a user to regularly adopt into her daily habit.  Preferring something scrappy like whiteboard sketches over Sketch files became more of a habit that I think I’d like to evangelize in future practices, as this encouraged higher collaboration and speed.
