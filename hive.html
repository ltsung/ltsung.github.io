The Search organization invested in incubating several product hypotheses through small team execution (1 product manager to ~1 designer to ~8 engineers). My team was responsible for understanding ephemeral, geo-fenced searching needs on mobile. Throughout the weeks we radically pivoted, ultimately releasing as “Hive” to college graduates and young professionals in Canada and the United States. We believed that creating a questions and answers community could organically surface interesting problems that aren't easily solvable through traditional search. Much of the learnings around forming communities and curating questions form the framework for the widely released <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yahoo-answers-now/id1111749046?mt=8" target="_blank">Yahoo Answers Now</a>.

Inspired by the lean design philosophy as detailed in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Designing-Great-Products/dp/1491953608" target="_blank">Lean UX: Designing Great Products with Agile Teams</a>, I frequently leverage the hypothesis format as a tool to drive the learning mindset, which is critical when navigating pivots.

Partnering closely with the User Research team, I planned and conducted bi-weekly studies where I captured natural user language to better empathize with user mental models. After each session, I would co-facilitate debriefs and early analysis prior to providing a formalized report to the larger teams and stakeholders.

                    In the spirit of "working scrappy", at times I would code up wireframe-like prototypes to quickly experiment with possible features we thought about bringing into production. For example, we wanted to explore the notion of enabling users to express moods and feelings through emoji to help add dimension to question ranking and community formation. Therefore, I implemented a filtered stream where a user could sort on emotion types and a fun means of contributing to shared emotions on a Questions page.

After landing on the hypothesis of forming communities around topics, we released an invite-gated experience for select regions in Canada and primarily friends and family in the United States. Because our hypothesis wasn't fully under the Yahoo brand umbrella, our small team campaigned grass-roots style and via Facebook ads where we saw first-hand how our key value propositions performed outside of initial lab testing.

                    As we developed more confidence in our product, we wanted to
                    take a step back and resolve unfinished design thinking.
                    Here I show a traversal through the key
                    use cases in the product and the types of alerts a user can
                    expect for items implicitly and explicitly engaged with.
                    I noted patterns across notification types and tiered them
                    in order to shed light on how to organize across in-app vs
                    push notifications. I considered how notifications
                    could guide a user into buying into the product's value over time.

                    Throughout each product pivot, we noted how we wanted to steer
                    communication within the product.  We constantly debated some
                    fundamentals (e.g. Is this a discussions forum? Are answers
                    opinion-based or factual?) and iterated upon the types of communities
                    we wanted to form.

It was crucial that each member of the team felt accountable to the product definition, design, development, and testing of the product. One of my best accomplishments in facilitating learning was when I held a design workshop with the engineers where we riffed personas, scenarios, and wireframes in a “studio” fashion. It created shared understanding and built team rapport early on.

The lean UX philosophy is all about enumerating assumptions regularly and quickly validating them. This mindset was helpful when it came to learning about our assumptions of what users would find interesting. We were humbled when we learned that our obsessions with features prevented us from ironing out a compelling product core.
                  </li>
                  <li>
It is too tempting as a designer to be fixated on the pixels and miss the big mark: our obligation is to get something real for a user to regularly adopt into her daily habit. Preferring something scrappy like whiteboard sketches over Sketch files became more of a habit that I think I’d like to evangelize in future practices, as this encouraged higher collaboration and speed.
