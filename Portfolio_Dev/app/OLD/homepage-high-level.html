       <p>Nutshell Diagram</p>
       <h2>Synopsis</h2>
       <p>
         I am currently the lead product designer for this artificial assistance platform that generates conversational bots on various chat platforms.  My stakeholders are primarily engineering teams whom I partner with for a unified, self-serve system for bot developers.  I also consult consumer-facing bot designers on platform capabilities and high-level bot scenarios.
       </p
       
       <p>NOTE: Due to the fact that this is still a young product, I will speak more abstractly in this case study.</p>
    
    
       <h2>Business Background</h2>
       <p>
       Yahoo has recently entered into the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/yahoo-facebook-messenger-bots/" target="_blank">conversational bot problem space</a>, having released news and entertainment bots via Facebook Messenger and Kik. As experiments, these bots have been developed in isolation.  An assistance platform became a high demand effort in order to streamline future bot development.
       </p>
       
       
       <h2>Product Problem</h2>
       <p>
       Creating a bot via the assistance platform can be summarized in the following steps:
         <ul>
	       <li>Mapping out use cases, text-based dialogs, and graphical cards</li>
	       <li>Defining reusable skills other bots can leverage</li>
	       <li>Determining utterance variations and matching intents</li>
	       <li>Training the bot model</li>
	       <li>Customizing and deploying on various chat platforms</li>
         </ul>
       </p>   
       
       <p>
       Thus far, the assistance platform effort has been expressed in a couple of disjointed tools addressing the above bot creation steps.  My first phase in shepherding this business goal was to simplify the existing tools and learn what users think in an international, company-wide Hackathon.
       </p>   
       <p>
       Ultimately, we want a self-serve, unified, end-to-end tool that meaningfully augments the bot development workflow.  Ideally, this platform can enable non-technical folks to design and ship a bot within minutes.
       </p>
       

       <h2>Execution</h2>
       <h3>Systems Thinking</h3>
       <p>
	     Many engineering teams develop different angles of this platform, so I need to discern when to think horizontally vs vertically when thinking about designing the platform systemically. I am mindful of the end-to-end goal, regularly working with key leads from individual teams to map out goals for unification. 
       </p>
       <p>
	    I also represent the consumer-facing bot designers in the evolution of this platform.  Regularly meeting with them for consulting and brainstorming, I negotiate key needs and design patterns that I can integrate into the platform design.   
       </p>
       
       <h3>
	   Methodology
       </h3>
       <p>Design Tools: Whiteboards, Sketch, Zeplin, Command line tools, CSS</p>
       
       <p>
       With my various stakeholders I map out the information architecture before I design wireframes and interactions via Sketch.  As the lead designer on this project, I also am in charge of the visual direction for the platform experience.  Throughout the platform design process, I've worked with individual teams in understanding specific workflows, even generating bots from scratch via command line tools to empathize with the underlying technology. I also pair closely with the frontend engineers to ensure specs are accurately represented in the product, assisting with CSS when needed.
       </p>
       

       <h3>Design Vision</h3>
       <p>
	   While this is a highly technical platform paving the way for the bot future, I want to consider the "human" elements of the experience.  The following are my design aspirations:
	   
	     <ul>
	       <li>The platform evokes a <strong>"maker mindset"</strong></li>
	       <li>Though powerful, it feels <strong>approachable</strong> and <strong>fun</strong> to thinker with</li>   
		   <li>Intrinsically feels <strong>forward-thinking</strong> and <strong>fresh</strong></li>   
	     </ul> 
       </p>
       


       <h2>Design Artifacts</h2>
       <p>
	   yada yada
       </p>


       <h2>Results Summary</h2>
       <p>
	   For our company Hackday, we piloted our initial platform which generated at least 40 bot hacks worldwide. We were widely considered the most popular topic amongst 5 participating worldwide office locations. 
       </p>
       <p>
       The data collection for our ideal platform is still in progress, as we are learning and building from scratch.
