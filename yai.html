        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
         <p class="text">
         Since the beginning of 2016, the Yahoo Search organization has been investing in launching chatbot experiments across Kik and Facebook Messenger (e.g. Yahoo News, MonkeyPet).  The need for standardizing and streamlining bot creation amongst engineers, editors, and scientists arose as well as the ambition to release our in-house technology externally to third party developers.  I took on the role of lead product designer where I partner closely with groups of technology experts to deliver a minimum viable platform that enables an end-to-end workflow of creating rich dialog design and configuring natural language understanding.  Thus far, we’ve shipped a small invite-only beta and currently are iterating on v2 of the platform for wider release.
         </p>
         <p class="text">
	       For my individual contribution, I concentrated on product ideation, overall user experience architecture, interaction design, and frontend coding within the production build (I coded within the SASS framework and edited React components). I organized the efforts of 2 part-time designers who filled in the gaps for visual design, information architecture, and interaction design.

            <p class="text">As I was onboarding onto the project, I examined the workflow the engineers had created via commandline to understand painpoints around learnability and usability.  I also surveyed competing platforms and technologies to learn the language and constructs.  With my gained understanding, I helped streamline the tools the engineers had mocked up in preparation for an international Hackday.  I helped drive visibility to the platform, which garnered 41 hack submissions across 5 Yahoo offices worldwide.</p>

            <p class="text">I worked with lead engineers in creating a mental model around bots and skills.  We wanted to design a system that encapsulated how various teams could leverage shared logic for concepts such as intents, fulfillment, and card design.  We devised possibilities to package bot logic in terms of Skills and deploy bots across any chat platform in parallel.</p>

            <h4 class="featurette-heading">Card System</h4>
            <p class="text">Most of the modules within the platform design are cards.  In order to design cards that show consistency in aesthetic and interaction, I first created them in abstract form.  I sectioned off where card content vs contextual actions needed to be defined with respect to context (e.g. use case, layout, relationship to other cards).  Also, I factored in how cards needed to be stacked depending on the need for information density.</p><br>
            <p>I have a couple of card types shown here: for Utterances, Intents/Skills, Dialogs, and the Bot Dashboard.

            <p class="text">The platform’s ability to tokenize user utterances and enable a bot developer to train the system in recognizing specific entities within a phrase is critical. Here is an early discussion snapshot I had with some lead engineers in discussing conditional random field tagging interactions and some concepts on bulk review workflows.  Because many of the platform's concepts are geared for technical power users, I often captured these conversations in a lightweight form that welcomes collaborative editing.</p>

            <p class="text">As we conceptualize the potential of the platform, we are mindful that we want the system to recognize a huge breadth of utterances.  Therefore, we are considering how we can cater to multimodal capabilities: we want to address both chatbot and VUI use cases.  Here is my early exploration on how I would assign modalities for a typical cooking workflow.  Due to the fact that cooking requires attention to the physical environment more so than a digital screen, I created rules around which aspects of the cooking workflow are best optimized for VUI vs text-based conversational flow.</p>

	        <p class="text">
	         I’ve had to navigate many perspectives coming from various engineering teams, scientists, product managers, our technical writer, and editors.  Most of my stakeholders lacked the visual vocabulary to articulate intricate technical details, so I often designed in lower fidelity with them to quickly and iteratively tease out the constraints.

	         Though it’s presumed that this platform has layers of detail and dependencies, I’ve been focused on uncovering truly critical themes to understand target audience and the competitive strengths of our product.
