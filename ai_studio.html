In 2016, the Yahoo Search organization invested in launching chatbot
experiments across Kik and Facebook Messenger (e.g. Yahoo News, MonkeyPet).
The need for standardizing and streamlining bot creation amongst engineers,
editors, and scientists arose as well as the ambition to release our in-house
technology externally to third party developers. I took on the role of lead
product designer where I partnered closely with groups of technology experts
to deliver a minimum viable platform that enables an end-to-end workflow of
creating rich dialog design and configuring natural language understanding.
I helped streamline an initial toolset and drove visibility to the platform,
which garnered 41 hack submissions across 5 Yahoo offices worldwide. We had shipped a small
invite-only beta and later discontinued efforts after 1 year of intense experimentation.

                    At a glance we see the essentials of creating a chatbot
                    in the navigation: means to design custom dialogs, to
                    depict complex decision trees, to bundle mapped intents
                    and utterances, to define entities, and to configure fulfillers.
                    The workspace also supports ease of training and deploying
                    a bot to a variety of chatbot platforms.  In the main content
                    area of this diagram, we see an example card of tokenizing
                    a user utterance where a bot developer/trainer can refine
                    the training of a model.

                     Early into the project, I examined the workflow
                     the engineers had created via commandline to understand
                     painpoints around learnability and usability behind creating
                     a bot from scratch. I also surveyed competing platforms and
                     technologies to learn the language and
                     constructs.

                   I worked with lead engineers in creating a mental model
                   around bots and skills. We wanted to design a system that
                   encapsulated how various teams could leverage shared logic
                   for concepts such as intents, fulfillment, and card design.
                   We devised possibilities to package bot logic in terms of
                   Skills and deploy bots across any chat platform in parallel.

Here is an early discussion snapshot I had with some lead engineers
in discussing conditional random field tagging interactions and some
concepts on bulk review workflows. Because many of the platform's
concepts are geared for technical power users, I often captured these
conversations in a lightweight form that welcomes collaborative editing.

                   Most of the modules within the platform design are cards. In
                   order to design cards that show consistency in aesthetic
                   and interaction, I first created them in abstract form.
                   I sectioned off where card content vs relevant actions
                   needed to be defined with respect to context (e.g. use case,
                   layout, relationship to other cards). Also, I factored in how
                   cards needed to be stacked depending on the need for information
                   density.
                   <br><br>
                   I have a couple of card types shown here: for Utterances,
                   Intents/Skills, Dialogs, and the Bot Dashboard.

I had to navigate many perspectives coming from various engineering teams,
scientists, product managers, our technical writer, and editors.
 Most of my stakeholders lacked the visual vocabulary to articulate
 intricate technical details, so I often designed in lower fidelity with
 them to quickly and iteratively tease out the constraints.

Though it’s presumed that this platform has layers of detail and dependencies,
I focused on uncovering truly critical themes to understand target

into framing a narrowed scope for the purposes of learning quickly stemmed
