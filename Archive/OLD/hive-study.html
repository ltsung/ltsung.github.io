       <h1>Hive Case Study</h1>
    
       <p>Nutshell Diagram</p>
       <h2>Synopsis</h2>
       <p>I co-led the product design, design prototyping, and user research partnerships for our product hypothesis aimed toward new college grads and young professionals.  We "dogfooded" our minimum viable product internal to Yahoo on a weekly cadence; in early July, we released minor tests publicly in Canada and the United States via iOS and Android stores.</p
       
       <p>NOTE: Due to the fact that this is still a young product, I will speak more abstractly in this case study.</p>
    
    
       <h2>Business Background</h2>
       <p>
	   Yahoo's Mobile Search organization funded experimental projects where teams acted as early-startups (e.g. ratio of 8 engineers to 1 product manager to 1 design lead). Each startup was tasked with conceptualizing and shipping a product from green field.  We embraced the mantra of "failing fast" as we painstakingly iterated our MVP week after week.
       </p>
       
       
       <h2>Product Problem</h2>
       <p>
	    After countless studies in-house and on the field, my product team eventually settled on tackling the idea of building vibrant communities in a Search context. We wanted to take advantage of the fact that certain sets of questions inherently cannot be solved through traditional search. One could argue that Yahoo Answers is already a classic Q&A product, but given the rise of mobile and our target demographic of college graduates and young professionals, we wanted to reimagine creating communities around questions.  
       </p>
       <p>
        The team was mindful of fellow key Q&A competitors and rising stars entering in a questions / discussions problem space specifically geared for mobile and have a similar age target.  We studied their unique value propositions and juxtaposed the pros and cons of their interaction models.
       </p>
       
       

       <h2>Execution</h2>
       <h3>Lean Philosophy</h3>
       <p>
	   I'm inspired by the principles laid out in <a href="#" target="_blank">Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden's Lean UX book</a>: I evangelized team-specific modifications within my area of the Search org to boost our ability to ship quickly. My product team led the way with weekly internal company-wide releases of our MVP, which meant that design and engineering processes needed to be optimally streamlined. Our evolutionary prototype had basic metrics reporting baked in that kept us accountable to our key performance indicators for iOS and Android usage. Our goal was to simply drive outcomes with a learning mindset and to practice discipline in avoiding waste or feature bloat.
       </p>
       
       <h3>
	   Methodology
       </h3>
       <p>Design Tools: Whiteboards, Sketch, Zeplin, Slack, In-house UI platform, Framer + Angular</p>
       <p>Research Tools: Hallway testing, Generative studies, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Google Surveys, Usability studies in Yahoo Labs</p>
       
       <p>
	   When time crunch is expected every day of every week, we needed to resort to extremely light-weight brainstorming tools as much as possible before quickly bringing designs into its highest fidelity in the final build.  Primarily white boarding was our way of capturing ideas, task flows, and low-fidelity wireframes. Our engineering team had a UI platform that captured much of our style guide, so we didn't waste time with in-depth specifications when it came to handoff. Due to my familiarity with the UI platform, there were occasions I tweaked templates for pixel perfection; otherwise, the focus wasn't on beauty but on shipping a product (still professionally presented) we could test quickly with users.
       </p>
       <p>
	   On occasion, there were times when we weren't sure that a feature should be implemented but still an open question to address separate from the engineering build. If these open questions required intricate interactions, I would use FramerJS prototyping to simulate interactions and animations.  If the prototype called for complex rendering, I would make some mock JSON and use Angular for data bindings.  I tend to use JavaScript as my language of choice, even in the context of mobile prototyping, as my background lies in building web applications.
       </p>
       <p>
	   In addition to being a co-lead product designer and prototyper, I partnered very closely with our Yahoo User Research and Data Insights teams.  I designed the user scripts used in generative and usability studies and actively interviewed user candidates.  I wanted to build empathy for the customer at the same time provide first-hand insight to my product partners.    
       </p>
       

       <h3>Design Vision</h3>
       <p>
	   After initial generative studies, we settled on a working draft of 3 user values:
	   <ol>
		<li><strong>Fun:</strong> Witty and Lighthearted</li>   
		<li><strong>Safe:</strong> Familiar and Intimate</li>   
		<li><strong>Helpful:</strong> Answering Questions Together</li>   
	   </ol> 
       </p>
       
       <p>As we were working through our vision of a healthy community, we thought about the psychological barriers that prevent meaningful contribution or inspire user drop-off.  I also co-facilitated a brainstorm where we had an empathy exercise focusing on the mindset of a new college student entering into her new profession. A new grad is perhaps going through a stressful time wrapping up finals, figuring out life plans, exploring career options with many questions top of mind.  Given the inherent stresses associated with new chapters, it's important that our app provide a safe yet fun environment that people can confide in.  We need to also reconcile the need to create a space where people's questions are answered in a timely and satisfactory manner.</p>
       
       <p>We also concluded we wanted to explore the technique of using anonymity in a community to encourage more candid discussion.  Though we were very thoughtful about the negative implications of anonymity, especially given our competitive analyses, we felt that we could explore variations of adding a lighthearted twist to the app's tonality.</p>



       <h2>Design Artifacts</h2>
       <p>
	   yada yada
       </p>


       <h2>Results Summary</h2>
       <p>
	   Within company dogfood, the app demonstrated cases of modest virality within 2 months of testing.  However, because it's a young hypothesis and we wanted to test feature variations before general adoption, we decided to soft launch in Canada and US iOS/Android app stores.
       </p>
       <p>
	   We didn't take advantage of Yahoo's traditional marketing means for media coverage; instead I helped design mini social media campaigns to solicit users. The app is very much iterating its key value prop.  What you're seeing demonstrated in this portfolio is one of the earlier iterations.     
	   </p>


       <h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
	   <p>Over the course of just a few weeks crafting the product from scratch, we learned some key lessons:</p>
	   <ol>
		 <li>Set the team up to learn constantly</li>  
		 <li>React quickly to what you've learned</li>  
		 <li>Nail the crux of the user need</li>  
		 <li>Shipping Weekly > Perfection</li>  
	   </ol>

       <h3>Set the team up to learn constantly</h3>
       <p>
	   It was crucial that each member of the team felt accountable to the product definition, design, development, and testing of the product.  We also had to invent ways where we could streamline development as we pivoted product definitions on a weekly basis. One of my best accomplishments in facilitating learning was when I held a design workshop with the engineers where we riffed personas, scenarios, and wireframes in a "studio" fashion. It created shared understanding and built team rapport early on.  
       </p>
       
      
       <h3>React quickly to what you've learned</h3>
       <p>
	   I've learned you can't be too married to a strategy when you're early in learning mode. Paired with intuition, the data we collected on a weekly basis shed light on micro truths.  We saw the benefit to having a scrappy mindset on all fronts - product, design, and development - when we were able to reach more promising numbers over the weeks.  
       </p>

      
       <h3>Nail the crux of the user need</h3>
       <p>
	   The lean UX philosophy is all about enumerating assumptions regularly and quickly validating them.  This mindset was helpful when it came to learning about our assumptions of what users would find interesting.  We were humbled when we learned that our obsessions with features prevented us from ironing out a compelling product core.  Furthermore, during lab studies, I made it a point to capture "user language" rather than speak in my regular tech jargon.  The empathy that I've gained during the course of this project trained my sensitivity needed to refine products.
       </p>

      
       <h3>Shipping Weekly > Perfection</h3>
       <p>
	   It is too tempting as a designer to be fixated on the pixels and miss the big mark: our obligation is to get something real for a user to regularly adopt into her daily habit.  Preferring something scrappy like whiteboard sketches over Sketch files became more of a habit that I think I'd like to evangelize in future practices, as this encouraged higher collaboration and speed.
