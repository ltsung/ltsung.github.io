            - Mission-minded. Innovative / exploratory. Loving.<br>

            - Senior Design Technologist, Amazon Alexa<br>

          </p>

          <p>
            I relocated to Seattle from the San Francisco Bay Area with a new mission in tech
            and in poverty alleviation. Currently, I am a Senior Design Technologist in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>'s
            <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Alexa</a> organization where I prototype experiments and tooling and envision new North Star
            platform opportunities. On the side, I serve as an Advisory Board member
            for the <a href="https://www.ugm.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Union Gospel Mission<a>. I have been fostering a passion for homeless ministry since 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            I experience thrill from tinkering with things, whether it's in my day job or personal life. I'm an avid food enthusiast
            who enjoys experimenting with new food gadgets, procuring fun ingredients, and exploring
            new cooking methods to create memorable experiences at the dining table. With a mind for tech and design, I love exploring my limits as a creative
            person who finds joy in serving and empowering others.

                  I led early prototyping experiments for <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2020/07/introducing-alexa-conversations-beta-a-new-ai-driven-approach-to-providing-conversational-experiences-that-feel-more-natural" target="
                  _blank">Alexa Conversations</a>, where I investigated how developers want to take advantage of AI to create
                  more natural multimodal experiences in a new Alexa Skill making paradigm.
                  I also illustrated and prototyped for a multimodal Skill example featuring Alexa Presentation Language (APL) called <a href="https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-pet-tales" target="_blank">"Pet Tales"</a>, where
                  it is featured as an Alexa Skill template on the developer console. Finally, I was a speaker for our digital conference where I talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5N45qnYuHk&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Alexa Hosted Skills</a>.

                  I'm helping my church <a href="https://seattlenewlife.org/" target="_blank">Seattle New Life</a> with local outreach in collaboration with UGM. We will challenge our community groups to make encouraging personalized cards for 180 front-line workers who serve homeless neighbors consistently
                  during a cold and more violent environment during COVID-19. We will assemble care packages for our homeless neighbors who struggle with job loss due to the economic crisis on top of addiction and hopelessness.

                <p>I have a budding collection of kitchen gadgets. I experiment with sous vide (<a href="https://www.chefsteps.com/joule" target="_blank">Joule</a> is my immersion circulator) and dehydration, and recently
                  upgraded my pots and pans with gear from <a href="https://hexclad.com/" target="_blank">Hexclad</a> and <a href="https://madeincookware.com/" target="_blank">Made-In</a>.
                  One upside of staying home during COVID is the opportunity to explore more ingredients to work with. I've also started to build a Japanese Whiskey collection.
