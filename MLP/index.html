          I relocated to Seattle from the San Francisco Bay Area with a new mission in tech
          and in poverty alleviation. Currently, I am a Senior Design Technologist in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>'s
          <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Alexa</a> organization where I prototype experiments and envision new North Star
          platform opportunities. On the side, I serve as an Advisory Board member
          for the <a href="https://www.The Mission.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Union Gospel Mission<a> (The Mission). I have been fostering a passion for homeless ministry since 2015.

          I experience thrill from tinkering with things, whether it's in my day job or personal life. I'm an avid food enthusiast
          who enjoys experimenting with new food gadgets, procuring fun ingredients, and exploring
          new cooking methods to create memorable experiences at the dining table. With a mind for tech and design, I love learning about my limits as a creative
          person who finds joy in serving and empowering others.

          <p>You can see a few of the things I've helped launch for <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-live" target="_blank">Alexa Live 2020.</a>
            I led early prototyping experiments for <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2020/07/introducing-alexa-conversations-beta-a-new-ai-driven-approach-to-providing-conversational-experiences-that-feel-more-natural" target="
            _blank">Alexa Conversations</a>, where I investigated how developers want to build new multimodal Alexa Skill experiences with an AI-driven dialog management paradigm.
            I also illustrated and prototyped for a multimodal Skill example called <a href="https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-pet-tales" target="_blank">"Pet Tales"</a> that features Alexa Presentation Language (APL), where
            you can use it as an Alexa Skill template on the developer console. Finally, I was a speaker for our virtual conference where I talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5N45qnYuHk&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Alexa Hosted Skills</a>, which are Skill scaffolds that give a developer immediate access to Alexa's most powerful features..

          <h3>Thanksgiving COVID-19 Project</h3>
          <!-- Photos TBD -->
          <p>
            I'm helping my church <a href="https://seattlenewlife.org/" target="_blank">Seattle New Life</a> with local outreach in collaboration with The Mission. We will challenge our community groups to make encouraging personalized cards for 180 front-line workers who serve homeless neighbors consistently
            during a cold and more violent environment during COVID-19. We will assemble care packages for our homeless neighbors who struggle with job loss due to the economic crisis on top of addiction and hopelessness. We are challenging ourselves to raise $10K for critical items to equip The Mission.

          <p>I have a budding collection of kitchen gadgets. I experiment with sous vide (<a href="https://www.chefsteps.com/joule" target="_blank">Joule</a> is my immersion circulator) and dehydration, and recently
            upgraded my pots and pans with gear from <a href="https://hexclad.com/" target="_blank">Hexclad</a> and <a href="https://madeincookware.com/" target="_blank">Made-In</a>.
            One upside of staying home during COVID is the opportunity to explore more ingredients. I've also started to build a Japanese Whiskey collection.
